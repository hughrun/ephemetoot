**ephemetoot** is a Python command line tool for deleting old toots.

As Mastodon now has similar functionality built in, `ephemetoot` is now in maintenance mode - no new features will be added, only security updates.

## Quickstart

You should have Python3 and pip installed, and an app access token on hand. More detail information is available in [the docs](https://ephemetoot.hugh.run)

Install with pip:
```shell
pip install ephemetoot
```
Create a config file:
```shell
ephemetoot --init
```
Do a first run in `--test` mode:
```shell
ephemetoot --test
```
Find out about other options:
```shell
ephemetoot --help
```

## Prior and related work
The initial `ephemetoot` script was based on [this tweet-deleting script](https://gist.github.com/flesueur/bcb2d9185b64c5191915d860ad19f23f) by [@flesueur](https://github.com/flesueur)

`ephemetoot` relies heavily on the Mastodon.py package by [@halcy](https://github.com/halcy)

Looks like [Gabriel Augendre had the same idea](https://git.augendre.info/gaugendre/cleantoots). You might prefer to use Gabriel's `cleantoots` instead.

## Usage
You can use `ephemetoot` to delete [Mastodon](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon) toots that are older than a certain number of days (default is 365). Toots can optionally be saved from deletion if:
* they are pinned; or
* they include certain hashtags; or
* they have certain visibility; or
* they are individually listed to be kept

## Contributing
ephemetoot is tested using `pytest`.
